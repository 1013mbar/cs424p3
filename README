git clone https://github.com/RandomEtc/modestmaps-processing.git

Then copy the modestmaps directory within to the Processing Libraries folder.

Get the SQLibrary from https://github.com/downloads/camillol/sqlibrary/SQLibrary-0.1.1.zip
IMPORTANT! Do not get the one at http://bezier.de/processing/libs/sql/ - it is horribly slow with SQLite.

Get prtree.jar from http://khelekore.org/prtree/git.shtml and install it as Libraries/prtree/library/prtree.jar
